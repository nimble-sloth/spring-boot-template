## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not open public issues for security problems.**

Use **Security → “Report a vulnerability”** on this repository. That creates a **private** advisory visible only to maintainers.

Optionally, you may email: `security@example.com` (replace with your address or remove this line if you don’t accept email reports).

When reporting, include:
- A clear description and minimal PoC / reproduction steps
- Affected module(s) (api, app, manager, ri, domain, desktop)
- Impact (e.g., RCE, information disclosure, DoS)

We will:
- **Acknowledge within 3 business days**
- **Triage within 7 days**
- Provide a fix or mitigation plan as soon as feasible (aim: within 30 days for high-severity issues)

## Scope
This repository is a **template**. If the issue affects a project that used this template, please report it to that project’s maintainers as well.

## Disclosure
We follow coordinated disclosure. After a fix is available, we may credit reporters (opt-in) in release notes.

## Safe-harbor
Non-malicious, good-faith research that respects privacy and does not disrupt services is welcomed. Do not exfiltrate data or use exploits beyond what’s necessary to demonstrate impact.
